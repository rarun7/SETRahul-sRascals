/**
 *  Represents a generic deck of cards.
 */

/*

  Tips:

  - Use an ArrayList<Card> to hold the cards.
  - Add and remove cards at the end of the list.
  - Use Collections.shuffle and Collections.sort to shuffle and sort the deck,
    or write your own methods.  If you write your own, use selection sort
    to sort and a similar algorithm to shuffle.  Use Math.random().
  - In the toString method, separate strings for individual cards with "\n".
